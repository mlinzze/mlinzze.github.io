**About**

I am an environmental economist. My main research interests are climate change and sustainable development. I work as Professor of Environmental Economics at the newly founded [Center for Critical Computational Studies](https://www.c3s-frankfurt.de/) at [Goethe University in Frankfurt am Main](https://www.goethe-university-frankfurt.de/en). I am also a [Wuebben Foundation Fellow](https://www.wuebben-stiftung-wissenschaft.org/en/home) and a Research Affiliate of the [CESifo Research Network](https://www.ifo.de/en/cesifo/cesifo-homepage). Most of my [research](https://mlinsenmeier.com/research/) seeks to quantify the consequences of climate change and to improve our understanding of how we can better adapt to them.

My research seeks to contribute to public debate and to better [policies](https://mlinsenmeier.com/policy/). Some of my work involves collaboration with the [International Monetary Fund](https://www.imf.org/), the [World Bank](https://www.worldbank.org/), and other national and international organisations.

Prior to my current appointment, I worked at the High Meadows Environmental Institute at [Princeton University](https://environment.princeton.edu/) and at the Climate School at [Columbia University](https://www.climate.columbia.edu/). I hold a PhD in Environmental Economics from the [London School of Economics and Political Science](http://www.lse.ac.uk/), where my PhD thesis won the Best Doctoral Dissertation Award by the [European Association of Environmental and Resource Economists](https://www.eaere.org/best-european-doctoral-dissertation-award).
