[{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"I am a PhD candidate in Environmental Economics at the London School of Economics and Political Science, where I am affiliated with the Department of Geography and Environment and the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment. From April to August 2022 I am visiting the School of International and Public Affairs at Columbia University.\nMy main research interests are climate change and sustainable development. I am particularly interested in the costs of climate change, adaptation to climate change, and in the political economy of climate change mitigation. I am also interested in the the effect of weather and climate on ecological systems and the use and benefits of weather forecasts.\nI have previously conducted research at the International Monetary Fund. I have also worked at the thinktank adelphi, designing, coordinating, and contributing to research and consultancy projects on a variety of environmental topics. In addition to my research and policy advice, I am a passionate teacher of economics and environmental sciences.\nI am co-organising the Shifting Landscapes 2022 conference for PhD students and early-career researchers. The conference will take place on June 16th and 17th in London. The program is now available on the conference website.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"","section":"authors","summary":"I am a PhD candidate in Environmental Economics at the London School of Economics and Political Science, where I am affiliated with the Department of Geography and Environment and the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment.","tags":null,"title":"","type":"authors"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1586476800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1586476800,"objectID":"20c3b8c7221536ac1d5c27f5b90ea3e1","permalink":"https://mlinzze.github.io/policy/","publishdate":"2020-04-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/policy/","section":"","summary":"policy","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1586476800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1586476800,"objectID":"f1d044c0738ab9f19347f15c290a71a1","permalink":"https://mlinzze.github.io/research/","publishdate":"2020-04-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/research/","section":"","summary":"research","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1586476800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1586476800,"objectID":"6d99026b9e19e4fa43d5aadf147c7176","permalink":"https://mlinzze.github.io/contact/","publishdate":"2020-04-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/contact/","section":"","summary":"contact","tags":null,"title":"Contact","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1586476800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1586476800,"objectID":"322dbaccf72a6d71f827fdb2866be935","permalink":"https://mlinzze.github.io/teaching/","publishdate":"2020-04-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/teaching/","section":"","summary":"teaching","tags":null,"title":"Teaching","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f26b5133c34eec1aa0a09390a36c2ade","permalink":"https://mlinzze.github.io/admin/config.yml","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/admin/config.yml","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"wowchemycms"}]
