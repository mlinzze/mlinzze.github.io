[{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"I am a PhD candidate in Environmental Economics at the London School of Economics and Political Science, where I am affiliated with the Department of Geography and Environment and the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment. From April to August 2022 I am visiting the School of International and Public Affairs at Columbia University.\nWith my research, I contribute to our fundamental understanding of the relationship between human activity and the natural environment. I also hope to contribute to better policies of managing this relationship. My main research interests are climate change and sustainable development. I am particularly interested in adaptation to climate change and in the political economy of carbon pricing.\nIn my PhD thesis I focus on the impacts of climate change and how we can adapt to them. Specifically, in two current working papers I examine the costs and benefits of temperature variability. For this purpose, I use economic theory and apply econometric methods to a wide range of data sources including national accounts, results of climate models, and satellite data.\nMy research is motivated by its policy relevance. In summer 2021 I have been working on carbon pricing at the Research Department of the International Monetary Fund. Before starting my PhD, I worked several years for the thinktank adelphi, designing, coordinating, and contributing to research and consultancy projects on a variety of environmental topics.\nHaving a multidisciplinary background I aim to build bridges between the natural and social sciences. I am also a passionate teacher of economics and environmental sciences. I have been designing and teaching courses on environmental economics, development and trade, sustainable development, and environmental change.\nResearch interests:\n Environmental economics Economics of climate change Climate econometrics Development economics Economic geography  I am co-organising the Shifting Landscapes 2022 conference for PhD students and early-career researchers. The conference will take place on June 16th and 17th in London. Thanks for all submissions that we received. A draft program will be shared soon.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"","section":"authors","summary":"I am a PhD candidate in Environmental Economics at the London School of Economics and Political Science, where I am affiliated with the Department of Geography and Environment and the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment.","tags":null,"title":"","type":"authors"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1586476800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1586476800,"objectID":"20c3b8c7221536ac1d5c27f5b90ea3e1","permalink":"https://mlinzze.github.io/policy/","publishdate":"2020-04-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/policy/","section":"","summary":"policy","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1586476800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1586476800,"objectID":"f1d044c0738ab9f19347f15c290a71a1","permalink":"https://mlinzze.github.io/research/","publishdate":"2020-04-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/research/","section":"","summary":"research","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1586476800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1586476800,"objectID":"6d99026b9e19e4fa43d5aadf147c7176","permalink":"https://mlinzze.github.io/contact/","publishdate":"2020-04-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/contact/","section":"","summary":"contact","tags":null,"title":"Contact","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1586476800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1586476800,"objectID":"322dbaccf72a6d71f827fdb2866be935","permalink":"https://mlinzze.github.io/teaching/","publishdate":"2020-04-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/teaching/","section":"","summary":"teaching","tags":null,"title":"Teaching","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f26b5133c34eec1aa0a09390a36c2ade","permalink":"https://mlinzze.github.io/admin/config.yml","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/admin/config.yml","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"wowchemycms"}]
