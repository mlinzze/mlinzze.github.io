He works as a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Climate School at Columbia University in the City of New York. His main research interests are climate change and sustainable development. Manuel is particularly interested in the costs of climate change, adaptation to climate change, and policy instruments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. His research interests also include the effect of weather and climate on ecological systems and the use and benefits of weather forecasts.\nManuel holds a PhD in Environmental Economics from the London School of Economics and Political Science. His PhD thesis won the Best Doctoral Dissertation Award by the European Association of Environmental and Resource Economists. His work has been published in leading interdisciplinary journals (e.g. Nature Climate Change) and economics field journals (e.g. Journal of Environmental Economics and Management). Prior to his current position Manuel worked at the International Monetary Fund and the international thinktank adelphi. In addition to his research and policy advice, Manuel is an experienced teacher of economics and environmental science.\nNews January 25th, 2024: Workshop announcement! Join us for a one-day even at Columbia University on Global Inequalities in Weather Forecasts. We aim to bring together researchers and practitioners from meteorology, economics and other disciplines to discuss issues and solutions related to this topic. The workshop is organised by Adam Sobel, Jeff Shrader, and myself. Call for papers with information about registration here. You can also reach out to me by email with any questions. January 4th, 2024: If you are at the ASSA conference this week, you can see joint work on Forecasts and Climate Mortality Estimates with Jeff Shrader, Derek Lemoine, and Laura Bakkensen presented in the session Weather and Climate on Saturday, Jan 6th, at 2:30 pm. December 7th, 2023: New working paper together with Jeff Shrader published today: Global inequalities in weather forecasts. Available here. Comments welcome! December 4th, 2023: Next week I will participate in a workshop on Earth Observation Data for the Social Sciences hosted by GESIS. I will give an invited keynote on Climate change impacts and adaptation: What satellite data tell us about our vulnerabilities and responses. Looking forward to three insightful days in Cologne, Germany. November 30th, 2023: The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) of the USA has released its newest Report on the Social Cost of Greenhouse Gases. My work with Gregor Schwerhoff and Adil Mohommad on the international diffusion of climate policy features prominently on page 16. You can find the report here. The full-text of our paper can be accessed here and a short summary here. November 11th, 2023: Today I published a new working paper: Global variation in the optimal temperature for recreational outdoor activity. You can read this early version of the paper here; comments by email are very welcome. November 9th, 2023: New paper published in the Journal of Macroeconomics: Seasonal temperature variability and economic cycles. I show that seasonal cycles of GDP can be attributed to a large extent to temperature variability. Open access here. A longer thread about the paper on X can be found here. October 10th, 2023: Looking forward to presenting results from a study on the economic costs of climate change in the UK together with lead-author James Rising at the Department for Environment, Food \u0026amp; Rural Affairs (DEFRA) of the United Kingdom today. You can find the final report here. September 13th, 2023: In two weeks, on September 27th, I will present results on global inequalities in weather forecasts at the Columbia Climate School Postdoctoral Research Symposium. You can find more about the Climate School Postdoctoral Research Program here. Applications for the next cycle are currently accepted, see here. July 27th, 2023: New paper out in the Journal of Environmental Economics and Management: Temperature variability and long-run economic development. In this study, I quantify the economic costs of temperature fluctuations at daily, seasonal, and interannual time scales. My results suggest that especially poor countries will suffer from larger temperature fluctuations in scenarios of future climate change. July 24th, 2023: Another conference this week, the AAEA annual meeting in Washington DC. I‚Äôll present new work on climate change and pollination ecosystem service on Tuesday, 25th, at 2:45 pm, in the session with the great title: Human vs. Nature: the Economic Value of Bees and Trees. See full program here. July 3rd, 2023: In a new paper in Nature Climate Change published today, me, Adil Mohommad, and Gregor Schwerhoff quantify the benefits of leadership in climate policy. The full paper is available here. We have also written a short and accessible policy brief here. Temporarily free access to the two papers here and here.

You can focus on the content and Wowchemy handles the rest.\nHighlight your code snippets, take notes on math classes, and draw diagrams from textual representation.\nOn this page, you‚Äôll find some examples of the types of technical content that can be rendered with Wowchemy.\nExamples Code Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for highlighting code syntax. You can customize the styles under the syntax_highlighter option in your config/_default/params.yaml file.\n```python import pandas as pd data = pd.read_csv(\u0026#34;data.csv\u0026#34;) data.head() ``` renders as\nimport pandas as pd data = pd.read_csv(\u0026#34;data.csv\u0026#34;) data.head() Mindmaps Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for mindmaps.\nSimply insert a Markdown markmap code block and optionally set the height of the mindmap as shown in the example below.\nA simple mindmap defined as a Markdown list:\n```markmap {height=\u0026#34;200px\u0026#34;} - Hugo Modules - wowchemy - wowchemy-plugins-netlify - wowchemy-plugins-netlify-cms - wowchemy-plugins-reveal ``` renders as\n- Hugo Modules - wowchemy - wowchemy-plugins-netlify - wowchemy-plugins-netlify-cms - wowchemy-plugins-reveal A more advanced mindmap with formatting, code blocks, and math:\n```markmap - Mindmaps - Links - [Wowchemy Docs](https://wowchemy.com/docs/) - [Discord Community](https://discord.gg/z8wNYzb) - [GitHub](https://github.com/wowchemy/wowchemy-hugo-themes) - Features - Markdown formatting - **inline** ~~text~~ *styles* - multiline text - `inline code` - ```js console.log(\u0026#39;hello\u0026#39;); console.log(\u0026#39;code block\u0026#39;); ``` - Math: $x = {-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac} \\over 2a}$ ``` renders as\n- Mindmaps - Links - [Wowchemy Docs](https://wowchemy.com/docs/) - [Discord Community](https://discord.gg/z8wNYzb) - [GitHub](https://github.com/wowchemy/wowchemy-hugo-themes) - Features - Markdown formatting - **inline** ~~text~~ *styles* - multiline text - `inline code` - ```js console.log(\u0026#39;hello\u0026#39;); console.log(\u0026#39;code block\u0026#39;); ``` - Math: $x = {-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac} \\over 2a}$ Charts Wowchemy supports the popular Plotly format for interactive charts.\nSave your Plotly JSON in your page folder, for example line-chart.json, and then add the {{\u0026lt; chart data=\u0026#34;line-chart\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} shortcode where you would like the chart to appear.\nDemo:\nYou might also find the Plotly JSON Editor useful.\nMath Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for $\\LaTeX$ math. You can enable this feature by toggling the math option in your config/_default/params.yaml file.\nTo render inline or block math, wrap your LaTeX math with {{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}}$...${{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} or {{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}}$$...$${{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}}, respectively. (We wrap the LaTeX math in the Wowchemy math shortcode to prevent Hugo rendering our math as Markdown. The math shortcode is new in v5.5-dev.)\nExample math block:\n{{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}} $$ \\gamma_{n} = \\frac{ \\left | \\left (\\mathbf x_{n} - \\mathbf x_{n-1} \\right )^T \\left [\\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n}) - \\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n-1}) \\right ] \\right |}{\\left \\|\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \\right \\|^2} $$ {{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} renders as\n$$\\gamma_{n} = \\frac{ \\left | \\left (\\mathbf x_{n} - \\mathbf x_{n-1} \\right )^T \\left [\\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n}) - \\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n-1}) \\right ] \\right |}{\\left \\|\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \\right \\|^2}$$ Example inline math {{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}}$\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n})${{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} renders as $\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n})$.\nExample multi-line math using the math linebreak (\\\\):\n{{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}} $$f(k;p_{0}^{*}) = \\begin{cases}p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=1, \\\\ 1-p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=0.\\end{cases}$$ {{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} renders as\n$$ f(k;p_{0}^{*}) = \\begin{cases}p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=1, \\\\ 1-p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=0.\\end{cases} $$ Diagrams Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for diagrams. You can enable this feature by toggling the diagram option in your config/_default/params.toml file or by adding diagram: true to your page front matter.\nAn example flowchart:\n```mermaid graph TD A[Hard] --\u0026gt;|Text| B(Round) B --\u0026gt; C{Decision} C --\u0026gt;|One| D[Result 1] C --\u0026gt;|Two| E[Result 2] ``` renders as\ngraph TD A[Hard] --\u0026gt;|Text| B(Round) B --\u0026gt; C{Decision} C --\u0026gt;|One| D[Result 1] C --\u0026gt;|Two| E[Result 2] An example sequence diagram:\n```mermaid sequenceDiagram Alice-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Hello John, how are you? loop Healthcheck John-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Fight against hypochondria end Note right of John: Rational thoughts!
